> A growing collection of utilities to make working with Promises easier and cleaner.

## âœ¨ What is it?

`promisary` is a growing collection of promise utilities to make async JavaScript easier and cleaner.

The first utility available is `hash`, which takes an object where the values are promises (or normal values) and returns a **single promise** that:

- Resolves to an object with the **same keys**, but with **resolved values**.
- Rejects immediately if **any** promise rejects.
- Works as a modern drop-in replacement for `RSVP.hash`.

Itâ€™s like `Promise.all`, but instead of getting an array of results, you get back a **named object**.

**More utilities are planned for future releases!**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
pnpm add promisary
# or
npm install promisary
# or
yarn add promisary
```

---

## ðŸ”¥ Usage

```typescript
import { hash } from 'promisary';

async function loadData() {
  const result = await hash({
    user: fetchUser(),
    posts: fetchPosts()
  });

  console.log(result.user);  // Resolved user
  console.log(result.posts); // Resolved posts
}
```

You can mix promises and plain values too:

```typescript
const result = await hash({
  a: 1,
  b: Promise.resolve(2),
  c: asyncOperation()
});
console.log(result); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: <resolved value of asyncOperation> }
```

If any promise rejects, the whole `hash` will reject immediately:

```typescript
await hash({
  a: Promise.reject(new Error('fail')),
  b: Promise.resolve(2)
});
// -> throws Error: fail
```

## ðŸ›  Why use this?

- **Drop-in replacement for `RSVP.hash`** in modern apps.
- **No extra dependencies** besides native Promises.
- **Tiny and tree-shakable** (~300 bytes minified).
- **TypeScript ready** and fully tested.

Perfect for cleaning up older Ember.js apps or anywhere you want better Promise ergonomics.

## âœ… Features

- Supports plain values and promises.
- Rejects early on failure.
- Fully typed with TypeScript.
- Lightweight and fast.
- More Promise utilities coming soon!

---

## ðŸ“… Roadmap

Here are some utilities planned for future releases:

- **`hashSettled`** â€” Resolve an object of promises like `Promise.allSettled`, capturing both successes and failures.
- **`timeout`** â€” Add a timeout to any promise, rejecting if it takes too long.
- **`raceObject`** â€” Like `Promise.race`, but for an object of promises.
- **`delay`** â€” Create a promise that resolves after a specified delay.
- **More to come!**
